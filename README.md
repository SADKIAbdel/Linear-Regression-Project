# Linear-Regression-Project
The Goal of this project is to analyse the results from an experiment that has been done to study
the performance of a given network. the theoretical model we have is:  T(S) = L + S/C.
- T is the time required for sending a message.
- S is the size of the message.
- C is the capacity of the network/ Links.
- L is the latency.
In this model we are considering here is neglecting a lot of details.
With this work we want to find two parameters the Latency and the Capacity, to do that they used
some random samples choosing different sizes and did some pings and at each time they
calculate the time needed to do the transmission.
We have two different datasets we need to analyse and do the linear regression.

You will find here a rmd file and the datasets i used that will help you to repruduce the analysis.
